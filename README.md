Redoing this project from scratch, Was busy with school exam for about a month so didn't have time to actually work on learning more of React.js
So here is the moment to do so
First of all I need to make the NAV that is used in every page, and make sure that the page is a single page app

What we need externally is...
- A way to get the API for country statistics
- Dark mode toggle
- Search bar functionality
Those are the major things that might become a problem, the API shit I have done before so it isn't something major
Here we go

END OF DAY
I didn't do much today, got other things that take up time, but I was able to prep up some stuff like media quaries for bootstrap, and getting CSS variables up (Though they are just placeholders for the real styles I'll implement later)
For now that's enough for today, for the first day of returning to this profession, it's nerve racking to be sure, but I am confident that I can do it

Use 2 moon Icons, the design doesn't specify a color change but a full-on icon type change, this is for the dark mode Icons
