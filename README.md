Redoing this project from scratch, Was busy with school exam for about a month so didn't have time to actually work on learning more of React.js
So here is the moment to do so
First of all I need to make the NAV that is used in every page, and make sure that the page is a single page app

What we need externally is...
- A way to get the API for country statistics
- Dark mode toggle
- Search bar functionality
Those are the major things that might become a problem, the API shit I have done before so it isn't something major
Here we go
